I regularly consume:
1. articles from [A Fresh Cup](https://afreshcup.com/)
2. artivles from [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/)
3. discussion on the Ruby Talk mailing list [Ruby Lang mailing lists](https://lists.ruby-lang.org)
4. SIGAVDI mailing from Avdi Grimm <avdi@sigavdi.email> (producer of the Ruby Tapas videos, which are quite good)

While I read many articles from these sources, I will only be listing some here.

I read the an article (posted in A Fresh Cup) about coding, and commiting to github, 30 minutes every day for practice purposes.  It's worth considering.
[30 minutes every day for your craft: Committing code to GitHub for 365 consecutive days](https://medium.com/@rieckpil/30-minutes-every-day-for-your-craft-committing-code-to-github-for-365-consecutive-days-eec8b73b5105)
